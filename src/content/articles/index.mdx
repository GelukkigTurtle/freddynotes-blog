Returning to the running lifestyle doing one of my favorites distances, 21 kilometers.

üìùüëü

It was a fresh morning and I took an Uber to reach the start point in the central park of 
San Jose, the capital of Costa Rica. I got ready and aboard the section for runners that were going to run the full and half marathon. Listen to the countdown from 10 to 0, as casual when you run these types of competitions.
I felt adrenalized again and I started to move my legs. I just simply enjoyed the circuit, it was two rounds of the same circuit. For the second round, I started to use my earbuds to listen to 80's music for a workout. The ones of Scorpions, Stan Bush, Bill Conti, and others. I really enjoyed this race, and returning to running, I did it again. and I completed the half marathon of San Jose. It took me 1:57 hours to complete it, that is a very good time as it's under 2 hours.

I hope to do these half marathons all over the capitals of different countries over the world.
