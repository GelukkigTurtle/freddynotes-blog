## Freddy Ayala.

Autodidact Software Engineer. I have worked on projects doing design, development, and implementation of background processes, Web Services, Web Applications, Android Mobile Applications, and Desktop Applications.
My favorite programming language is Java, however, I'm always playing with some JavaScript Framework or JVM based language.
My country of origin is El Salvador but now I'm located in Heredia, Costa Rica. Looking to never stop traveling and always making a difference.
 Currently enjoying work and challenges at <XA href="https://www.intertecintl.com/">Intertec International</XA> .
