The Duran Sanatorium is an abandon and touristic place located in Prusia Cartago Costa Rica.

:pencil2:

This day We went to the Sanatorium, a famous place in Costa Rica. This place was founded in 1918 and it was working until 1973 because the audience of interns with tuberculosis was decreasing. Supposedly this place is haunted and many people confirm that they had experienced some paranormal situation. There are rumors that some Nurse ghost appears and you can hear some scream voices at night.

In my experience, I did not feel any of those paranormal situations but some of my friends Did. Maybe because I don't believe too much in this horror and paranormal things or I'm just lucky. We went to some friends from Costa Rica and Venezuela and we had a good time there. If you ask me for recommending this place is attractive only if you like to visit historical places or museums otherwise you can rather visit other near places like the Irazu Volcano.
